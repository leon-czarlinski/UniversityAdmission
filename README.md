## UniversityAdmission
University Admission Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression is a hands-on project where I trained a regression model to find the probability of a student getting accepted into a particular university based on their profile.

Think of this project as a project that could be implemented at the university side. The university could collect all the data beforehand in which the commitee, for example, that decide which studens should be able to enroll in it will be accepted in a university program based on the features we can extract all that data such as GRE Score, TOEFL score, university rating, statement of purpose, Letter of Recommendation, GPA and research experience. 

## Data Analytics Methodology
**Transforming data into insights**: the six steps of data analytics include: *ask*, *prepare*, *process*, *analyze*, *share*, and *act*. 
1. **Ask**: effective questions and collaborate with leaders and managers who are interested in the outcome
1. **Prepare**: It all start wth a solid preparation. During this step, the analysts identify what data they need to achieve the succesful result they identified in the previous step.
1. **Process**: In this step, the data analyst make sure how data would be collected, stored, managed, and protected.
1. **Analyse**: This is the moment where the data analyst dive into the data, combine data from multiple sources, do the calculations and data validations.
1. **Share**: Share the results with stakeholders involved in the project.
1. **Act**: The last stage of the process where the team of analysts work with stakeholders within their company and decide how best to implement sugegstions and actions based on the fidings. 

You will see that this project will not cover all the steps above, but the idea of initially listing all steps is to show how to work in a data analysis process. 

## Tasks in this project
1. Understand the problem statement
1. Import libraries and data sets
1. Perform exploratory data analysis
1. Perform data visualization
1. Create training and testing dataset
1. Train and evaluate a linear regression model
1. Train and evaluate an artificial neural network
1. Train and evaluate a decision tree and random forest models
1. Calculate regression model KPIs

## Data Source
For this project we will be using the [Data source](https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions) available at kaggle.

## Code Source
To develop the analysis, I used the Colab notebook available on **GitHub**. [Click here](https://github.com/leon-czarlinski/UniversityAdmission/blob/main/Graduate_Admission_Prediction.ipynb) to access the file and see the results. 

Check some of the libraries used to develop the analysis:

```
import pandas as pd #used for data frame manipulation
import numpy as np #used for numerical analysis
import seaborn as sns #used for data visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #used for data visualization
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
```
